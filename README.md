--About CBIT Connect

CBIT Connect is a unified super app designed to bring the entire CBIT ecosystem into a single digital platform for students, faculty, and alumni.

Today, CBIT services are scattered across multiple websites, notice boards, WhatsApp groups, and manual processes. Students struggle to find information. Alumni are disconnected. Clubs and events lack visibility.

CBIT Connect solves this by becoming the single digital entry point for everything related to CBIT.

--What the App Brings Together

All CBIT websites in one place

Real time news, circulars, and announcements

Clubs, committees, and event participation

Alumni network with industry connect (RFC feature)

Digital forms and request tracking

Newsletters and academic resources

Interactive campus map

Centralized notifications and search

--Key Highlight: Alumni RFC (Request for Contact)

Students can discover alumni working in industry, send a structured request to connect, and build meaningful mentorship and career guidance directly through the app.

This creates a live bridge between campus and industry.

Who This App Is For

Students to stay informed and engaged

Faculty to communicate and manage activities

Alumni to stay connected and mentor students

Administration to digitize processes and communication

--Vision

To transform CBIT into a digitally connected campus where information, opportunities, and people are seamlessly linked through one smart platform.

--Outcome

CBIT Connect is not just an app.
It becomes the official digital ecosystem of CBIT.
